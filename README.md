## Purpose

This project is the repository of my portfolio website.

This website aims to showcase my differents projects, my skills and experiences and of course my capabilities to build a React website like this.


## Method used
* **React.js:** framework for Front-End
* **Javascript**
* **Html - CSS**
* **Typescript**
* **Framer-Motion:** library for animations
* **Figma:** app for web design

## Design
In addition of having coded the website from scratch, I used the Figma application to fully design it.

You can find the Figma files inside the Figma folder including a design model of the website.

## Mobile compatibility

This website is also designed for mobile compatibility thanks to:
* Responsive design
* CSS Media query

(but some animations will still look better on computer ðŸ˜‰)
